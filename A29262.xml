            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>WHEREAS the Propagation of the Chriſtian Faith, and the Increaſe of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Knowledge, amongſt all ſorts of Perſons in His Majeſty's Foreign Plantations, are the Wiſhes, Deſires, and Prayers, of all Pious and Serious Chriſtians, and ſuch as are zealous of God's Glory, and the Salvation of Men's Souls. AND WHEREAS that Bleſſed Work, next under God, does principally depend upon the Abilities of the Clergy of thoſe Parts, the Exemplarineſs of their Lives, and their Induſtry in Teaching others; WHEREAS ALSO the Clergy, that are already in the Plantations, as well as thoſe who are to be ſent thither, cannot (Humanly ſpeaking) be ſo capable of Informing themſelves, and of Inſtructing others in the Deſign of Chriſtianity, in the Nature of the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> in the Meaning and Importance of the Articles of Our moſt Holy Faith, and in the Nature and Extent of all Chriſtian Duties, without the Aſſiſtance of ſome good Commentators upon the Holy Scriptures; and one, at leaſt, or more of thoſe Authors, who have beſt treated upon each, and every of thoſe Points; WHEREAS ALSO for the Supply of that Want, Men of Parts, and addicted to Study, will hardly be induced to leave the Expectations they may have of better Encouragement and Improvement in their Native Country, to go to remote Parts and Climates leſs agreeable, without ſuch Advantages, as will over-balance all Conſiderations inclining them to ſtay at home; and, eſpecially, not without a competent Proviſion of ſuch Books as are neceſſary for their Studies in thoſe Places where they are to ſerve (few of them that go over from hence being able to furniſh themſelves with ſo many Books as they ſhall need) AND, LASTLY, WHEREAS Inſufficiency and Scandal in the Clergy of thoſe Places, in all probability, would be moſt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully prevented, both in this and future Ages, ſhould every Parochial Miniſter in the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations have a ſufficient Library of well-choſen Books, of all thoſe kinds before-mention'd, in which he might ſpend his Time to his own Satisfaction, and with Improvement and Profit to himſelf and others.</p>

                  <list>
                     <item>1.

                     <item>2. THAT every Parochial Library ſhall be affixed in a decent and large Room of the Parſonage-Houſe of ſuch-Pariſh, there to remain to the ſole Uſe of the Miniſter thereof for the time being, unto all future Generations, and to be as UNALIENABLE as any other the Rights add Dues of the Church, which are Aſcertained by Law.</item>

                     <item>3. THAT in order to the Preſervation of every ſuch Library to ſucceeding Ages without Loſs, as far as can be Humanly provided in any thing of that kind, there be made an exact Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of the Books belonging to the Library of each Pariſh; and that every ſuch Catalogue be fairly written in Four Books of Vellum provided for that purpoſe: The Firſt whereof to be left with the Lord Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> for the time being; a Second with his <hi>Commiſſary,</hi> or ſome Chief Clergy-man in every of thoſe Plantations where ſuch Libraries are provided; and a Third to remain in the reſpective Libraries themſelves; and a Fourth to be depoſited in the <hi>Veſtry</hi> of each of the ſaid Pariſhes.</item>
                     <item>4. THAT the <hi>COMMISSARY</hi> be obliged, at leaſt once in Three Years, Perſonally to make a <hi>Parochial Viſitation;</hi> And then, beſides the Charge of his Duty in other reſpects, that it be incumbent alſo upon him, particularly to Inſpect the <hi>Parochial Libraries,</hi> and to ſee that none of the Books be Imbezell'd or Loſt: And that the Church-Wardens of each Pariſh be alſo obliged, every Year, before the Viſitation, to inform themſelves in what Condition the ſaid Books are, and to Preſent accordingly at the Viſitation.</item>
                     <item>5. THAT for farther Security to preſerve them from Loſs and Imbezelment, and that they may be known where-ever they are found, in every Book, on the one ſide of the Cover, ſhall be Letter'd theſe Words: SUB. AUSPICIIS WILLIELMI III.: on the other ſide the Name of the Pariſh to which theſe Books do belong: EX. GR. E. BIBLIOTHECA DE MARY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOWN: E.

                  <p>The Perſon now Deputed by the Lord Biſhop of <hi>LONDON,</hi> to be his COMMISSARY in <hi>MARY-LAND,</hi> for the Propagation of Our moſt Holy Religion amongſt the Infidels, for the Inducement of Sober and Serious Young Divines to go to the Foreign Plantations, and for the better Qualifying them for ſo Noble and Chriſtian an Employment, is now wholly buſied in Collecting of PAROCHIAL LIBRARIES of Choice and Uſeful Books, for the perpetual Uſe of ſuch of the Clergy, who ſhall now undertake that Voyage, and for all thoſe who ſhall ſucceed them. AND certainly a more ſuitable Encouragement to Men of good Parts, and Inclinations to go upon ſo Bleſſed a Miſſion, could not be thought of: For as it is Books alone which will encourage the moſt Studious, Virtuous, and conſequently the moſt Uſeful Perſons to go over; ſo it is an Encouragement that is in a manner neceſſary to be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Foreign Plantations; ſince few or none at their firſt going over, are in a Condition to provide themſelves therewith; and when they are there, Books are hardly to be met with, by thoſe who ſhall be able to buy them. And yet without a competent Proviſion of ſeveral Uſeful and Neceſſary Books, it is morally impoſſible that any ſhould be enabled to inſtruct their People.</p>
                  <p>And now that ſuch Excellent Works are jointly begun, and carrying on, What a happy Conjuncture is this (which perhaps may not again recur) for Perſons who are Piouſly diſpos'd, to give their helping hand towards ſuch Bleſſed and Glorious Deſigns, as the Propagating of True Chriſtian Knowledge and Practice, in Places formerly ſo much Uncultivated therewith. Surely if he who <hi>Converteth a</hi> ſingle <hi>Sinner from the Errour of his Ways, ſhall hide a multitude of Sins,</hi> what abundant Matter for comfortable Reflections upon a Death-bed, ſhall that Perſon lay up, who ſhall contribute towards providing of the moſt proper and genuine Means, next to the Divinely Inſpired Writings, of Converting many poor Souls, not only in this, but in all future Generations, even ſo long as the Sun and Moon endureth.</p>
